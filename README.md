#OddEvenArray
The first part of the program first prompts the user to enter the size of the array. It then declares two arrays named 'even' and 'odd' of size 'size'. The program then uses a for loop to accept the numbers from the user and move them to the respective arrays depending on whether they are even or odd. Finally, the program prints the even and odd arrays to the console using another for loop.

The second part of the code finds 2 neighboring numbers in an array with the smallest distance to each. The function returns the index of the 1st number.

The last part of the program converts an array into an arraylist and vice versa.
